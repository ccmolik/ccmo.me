Here's a list of things I like in my world (+1), and a list of things I don't like (-1).

## computing

Computers in general get a net zero because they're awesome and keep me employed but augh.


### +1

- CentOS: It can be old...erm, stable. But it Just Works 99% of the time, and if not someone's probably figured out a way to make it work. 
- Python
   - [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) is the easiest way I've found to template out web apps
   - [eve](http://python-eve.org) is flask but with a free REST APi and mongodb (and I guess redis?)
   - [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) makes my life much easier when dealing with web traffic
- Puppet: A coworker of mine said "Puppet should choose whether to be declarative, functional or object-oriented. Or at least pick two." I agree that the OO stuff of Puppet is a great path to c'thulu, but it's still one of the best-supported config management systems out there.
- VIM: Emacs's workflow never clicked for me. If I'm doing quick work, i'll run to vi/vim as quickly as possible.
- Sublime Text: Super useful, super extendable, and VIM mode makes my fingers smile.


### -1

- Ubuntu: I've been burned by it too often in production. Updating it isn't as compatible as one would think, managing herds of it isn't fun, Canonical's support is awful, and I'm not a fan of them trying to segment Linux more than it already is.
- Perl: It's {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }}. Stop writing perl!
- PHP: It's {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }}. Stop writing php!
   - PHPMyAdmin: more liek PHPMySQLInjection, amirite?
- NPM: I've never used or had to maintain such a broken packaging system. Scarcely a week goes by without something stupid changing in a package that breaks the CI stuff I work on.
- Java SSL: Ever try to explain to someone deploying a Java app how to add a CA, client cert, or client privkey to a java keystore? You know the pain.
- Jaded OS X haters: I work in a Linux/Unix world. Apple's hardware's overpriced, sure, but the OS isn't terrible. If you hate it for the sole reason that it's an Apple product, you've never used it. I'll admit it can get in the way of getting stuff done, but the whole ecosystem is very well integrated.
- Markdown syntax: As I write this, I've affirmed the fact that markdown's syntax is annoying and I never get it right on the first try.
- VMWare's VCenter API: Things are super inconsistent and undocumented. I've had to resort to trying to reverse-engineer Perl code too often, and [pyvmomi](https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi)'s docs are practically nonexistant. Furthermore, the API samples they ship with are terribad. 

That being said, if you like stuff that I mark as -1 and can back up your argument, I'm more than happy to hear it. And I'm more than happy to take a second look. And I'm more than happy to debate on it.
