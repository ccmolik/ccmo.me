Well it's been a while since I bothered trying to maintain a website. Every once in a while I get the urge to scribble something down and post it online, only to realize I have zero interest in maintaining something like WordPress (I hate PHP as a general rule.)

Maybe I'll actually update this every once in a while.

I'm doing this with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) because I can dig writing things in markdown out of laziness. Sue me.
