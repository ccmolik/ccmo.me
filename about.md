## About Me
I'm a Silicon Valley sysadmin/ops guy. I'm a huge fan of RedHat-based distros (ok, CentOS) and write puppet, python, and bash. I dabble in Angular and Ruby, too. Some day I'll learn node.js and do something useful (or not) with it.

I'm not a web designer, so my stuff might look kind of ugly or stock. Oh, well.

I love *nix sysadmin work. Specifically, I love getting *nix to play nice with other systems (OS X, Windows). If you take anything away from me from this site, know that though I've got prejudices within the Linux/Unix world I'm all about getting stuff done and operating in a mixed environment.

## My past
I grew up in suburban Cleveland, OH and decided to GTFO.  Landing a gig in Silicon Valley has made me never look back, and I'm thankful for the opportunities I had to move out here.

I graduated cum laude from [RIT](https://rit.edu) in 2013 from the [B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing & Information Sciences](https://www.rit.edu/gccis) with a degree in [Information Technology](https://ist.rit.edu), minors in Networking and System Administration and Communications.

While in college, I maintained the infrastructure for [WITR Radio](https://witr.rit.edu) and even DJ'd a bit (If you were one of the five people that heard Chris the Engineer talking about Passion Pit, Sleigh Bells, or Metric ad nauseum, my apologies.)


## Free Time
I'll be the first to admit I spend too much of my free time screwing around with new software stacks, but I've got interests in a few different places.  I'm a San Jose Sharks fan and I sympathize with Buffalo Sabres fans (it's that whole "this is my first hockey team I've been exposed to" thing.)  I'm also a 49ers fan, and I want to see the Browns do well (so you can say I'm delusional.)  

My college radio experience at RIT kept piquing my interest in broadcast media and radio infrastructure.

I maintain that the second-most important class I took in college was called "Wines of the World" and that opened me up to the world of wine. I enjoy trying new wines and convincing people that wine can be worth enjoying.

I also game a bit; you can catch me being awful at League of Legends and abandoning projects in Minecraft. I've got a SNES, Sega Dreamcast, and a Wii U at home as well that occasionally waste hours of my life.
